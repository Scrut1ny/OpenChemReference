  <summary>General Procedure</summary>

  ### Preparation of Acid Mixture
  - **Safety First**: Work under a fume hood with full protective gear.
  - **Mixing Acids**: In a separation funnel, carefully mix concentrated sulfuric acid and concentrated nitric acid in a 1:1 ratio. This is the nitrating mixture.
  - **Cooling**: Place the separation funnel in an ice bath to keep the temperature low (below 25°C, preferably around 10-15°C).

  ### Addition of Glycerin
  - **Slow Addition**: Slowly add glycerin dropwise to the cooled nitrating mixture while continuously stirring.
  - **Temperature Control**: Maintain the reaction temperature below 25°C. Use an ice bath to control exothermic reaction heat.

  ### Reaction Monitoring
  - **Stirring**: Continue stirring and adding glycerin slowly to prevent rapid temperature rise.
  - **Observation**: Look for any signs of excessive heat or instability. If the mixture becomes too hot, stop adding glycerin and allow it to cool.

  ### Separation
  - **Phase Separation**: After all the glycerin has been added, allow the mixture to settle. Nitroglycerin, being denser, will form a separate layer at the bottom.
  - **Extraction**: Carefully separate the nitroglycerin layer using a separation funnel.

  ### Washing
  - **Neutralization**: Wash the nitroglycerin with a sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) solution to neutralize any remaining acids.
  - **Water Wash**: Further wash with distilled water to remove any remaining impurities.

  ### Storage
  - **Safe Storage**: Store the nitroglycerin in small quantities in a cool, dark place in a shock-absorbent container.
  - **Labeling**: Clearly label the container and follow all regulatory guidelines for storage and handling.
